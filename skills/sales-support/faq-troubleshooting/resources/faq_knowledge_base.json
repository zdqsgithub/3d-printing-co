        "question": "What's the difference between PLA and ABS?",
        "answer": "PLA is easier to print, biodegradable, and great for beginners. ABS is stronger, heat-resistant, but requires an enclosed printer and produces fumes. For most projects, we recommend starting with PLA and moving to ABS only when you need the extra strength/heat resistance.",

        "question": "Which filament is food-safe?",
        "answer": "PETG is the most food-safe FDM filament we carry. However, keep in mind that 3D printed objects have tiny layer lines that can harbor bacteria. For food contact, we recommend: (1) Use PETG, (2) Apply a food-safe epoxy coating, (3) Don't use for hot foods. For full food-safety, consider our resin printing service with food-grade resin.",

        "question": "How should I store filament?",
        "answer": "Keep filament in a sealed bag with desiccant packets when not in use. Moisture absorption causes bubbles, stringing, and weak prints. Signs of wet filament: popping/hissing sounds during printing, rough surface finish, excessive stringing. We sell vacuum storage bags and desiccant kits.",

        "answer": "Try these in order: (1) Re-level your bed using the paper test, (2) Clean the bed with isopropyl alcohol, (3) Increase bed temperature by 5°C, (4) Slow your first layer to 20mm/s, (5) Use a glue stick or hairspray for extra adhesion. We also sell PEI spring steel sheets ($15) which give excellent adhesion for all materials.",

        "answer": "Try a cold pull: (1) Heat nozzle to printing temp, (2) Push filament through manually, (3) Cool nozzle to 90°C (PLA) or 160°C (ABS), (4) Pull filament out firmly — it should bring debris with it. Repeat 2-3 times. If that doesn't work, use the included acupuncture needle or replace the nozzle. We sell nozzle variety packs for $18.",

If prints stick to FEP instead of build plate, re-level your build plate.",

        "answer": "FDM printing with PLA is generally safe for supervised children. PLA is non-toxic and low-odor. Safety tips: (1) Always supervise — hot end reaches 200°C+, (2) Keep fingers away from moving parts, (3) Use PLA only (avoid ABS fumes), (4) Print in a ventilated area, (5) Don't touch prints immediately after — they're hot! Resin printing is NOT recommended for children due to toxic uncured resin.",
